My name is Samuel W.R. Tieman, but most people call me Sam. I’m an ethical hacker and cybersecurity enthusiast.

On this blog, I share posts about things I’m learning in the field of cybersecurity—ranging from different techniques for getting an initial foothold to detailed write-ups of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges I’ve completed. This space serves both as a learning journal for myself and a reource for others interested in offensive security.
